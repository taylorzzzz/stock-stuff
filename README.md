# Stock Stuff

This is a little express app I built while learning D3.js. 

Daily stock price data for the past 100 days is retrieved from [AlphaVantage](https://www.alphavantage.co/) and various, trivial stats are calculated e.g the average change on days that follow up days vs. down days. The results are then displayed in graphs using D3.
